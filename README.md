# Artificial Intelligence A-Z 2024: Build 7 AI + LLM & ChatGPT course notes

This repository contains the Jupyter notebooks I developed while taking the **Artificial Intelligence A-Z 2024: Build 7 AI + LLM & ChatGPT** course on Udemy. The notebooks include my personal notes, code snippets, and solutions to the exercises provided in the course. They serve as a comprehensive reference for revisiting key concepts and techniques in artificial intelligence.

## Course Overview

The course covered a wide range of AI topics, with a particular focus on deep learning and reinforcement learning techniques, as well as fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). The main sections included:

- **Section 1**: Deep Q-Learning – Fundamentals of reinforcement learning and implementing Deep Q-Learning algorithms.
- **Section 2**: Deep Convolutional Q-Learning – Extending reinforcement learning with convolutional neural networks for complex environments.
- **Section 3**: A3C (Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic) – Understanding and applying advanced reinforcement learning techniques.
- **Section 4**: Fine-tuning a pre-trained LLM (Llama 2 by Meta) with Hugging Face – Practical approach to fine-tuning language models for specific tasks.

I enrolled in this course to strengthen my skills in deep learning, reinforcement learning, and large language models. 

## Reflections

Completing the course was a valuable experience, and here are some key takeaways:

- Gained a solid understanding of neural networks, including their structure, operation, and training processes.
- Learned to implement and fine-tune reinforcement learning models to solve problems in dynamic environments.
- Acquired practical skills for fine-tuning large language models using the Hugging Face library, including adapting Llama 2 for customized tasks.
